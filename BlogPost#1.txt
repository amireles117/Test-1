What I Learned From Building My Own Email Server
When building my email server there is a lot of things that needs to be done making sure that you can filler out the spam and legit emails that needs to be done and have the common knowledge of understanding that unauthorized access, and other malicious activities is crucial. To implement SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is necessary that will be able to authenticate emails and prevent spoofing.

My Favorite OSINT Tool and Why
My favorite tool that i used will probably be WHOIS lookup this will allow me to start digging up information from who and where this will allow me to get a name, address, phone number and more information. With this i can help be do a reverse DNS lookup that will help find domains linked to the IP address. With digging deeper having to use social media profile lookup this can help identify associated social media accounts from the email address and names that come up from the account when looking up if they are part a company, owner or see if they have there one site. Information is what is needed to do investigations
